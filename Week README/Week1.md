# Week 1

_A weekly journal to keep track of the work I am doing towards each of the goals._

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

------

## Goals

1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
    - [Test driving 1 project](https://github.com/KajaMaria/TDD_Ruby_Students_names_and_motivation)

2. Pair using the driver-navigator style
    - [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/KajaMaria/boris_bikes)

3. Follow an effective debugging process
    - Debugging workshop


4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP
    - [Airport](https://github.com/KajaMaria/airport_challenge)
    - [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/KajaMaria/boris_bikes)

## My first week at Makers

Overall it was an exciting week. From being complety lost to fairly easily moving through our weekend challenge. I am sure there are still parts to improve but I feel like I am a better developer today than on Monday!

## This Week

-TDD
-Debugging
-OOD
-Pairing - Feedback

## Tuesday 

## Debugging Techniques 

 1. Getting the right process
 2. Exercises -> Program with a number of Apps

 Process:
 - Tighten the loop -> Where is the loop
 - Get visibility -> What is the code doing
 - Don't change your test until you know the answer


 Type of Bugs: 

 1. Structure of the code : 
- Unexpected Error
- Syntax
- Unexpected/ Expected end
- Nil class
- No method
- Syntax

 2. General errors : 
 - Test Fails
 - loops
 - Stack error

 - "p" -> use it to return a part of your code (console log)

## Pairing 

1. Driver -> writing code
2. Navigator -> direct the driver

 NOTE -> Work on one step at the time 

How did it go?

 - First pairing session was challenging but we have managed to get far in our code.

 - Feedback :
 
   Thanks, I would say that you were superb to work with, enjoyable session! Even when we hit walls, I liked that you didnâ€™t panic, (well you didn't show it anyway) you just took your time out to regroup (do ur research) and go again. Also like how you broke down stories quickly, You're very fast at processing.... give your drivers time to catch up.


## Wednesday ##

Setting SMART goals 
- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Relevant
- Time- bound

## Good Plan -> Do/ Practice -> Reflect/ Feedback & Evidence 


How did it go? 

- I was focusing on TDD and OOD. I am currently working on a little program which would allow students to input their name and motivation.
- Pairing: We have moved on on the the Boris Bike challenge. It is getting a little bit more complicated and we were using "Walkthroughs" for a couple of questions. It is much harder to design a new project starting from TDD.


## Thursday 

Reflection Session 
1. Successes
- Understanding logic behind tests

2. Struggles
I am struggling with starting from testing.

3. Setting Goals/ Reflecting on goals from yesterday?
- My Goal is to test and write another class for my TDD project

Marketing and Careers 

- Don't think about finding the job until the very end :) Just focus on coding

TDD workshop 

1. Bread down a problem into simple tests.
  - Turn those steps into tests
  - Use tests to TDD a solution


2. Breaking down your problem:

 Example: Working on Roman Numerals 

- Don't think how are you going to solve the problem - breaking it down to classes and irb

- You want to be able to give an integer and receive a roman numeral:
    When I input number 1 , I can see I
    When I input number 2 , I can see II (...)
    (...) When I input number 7, I can see VII
    (...) When I input 10, I can see X


  - Problem solving
   I want to /convert/ integer to /Roman Numbers/
   Why are you calling this test and what are you expecting to get back?
   Break it down and make it as simple as possible  and move one to the next simple step in tests etc.

How did it go?

- We have continued with Boris Bikes and i have tried starting another TDD practical.
- I'm starting to understand testing but i still need instructions and i ask for help.
- I am having issues creating paths for my code ( what is going to be my class, method, what is going to depend on what)
- It is much harder staying focused if your pairing partner doesn't really want to be there and uses short cuts without thinking thing over.


## Friday ##

1. How are you tracking your progress?

- What did you do yesterday?
- What goals are you setting yourself and how are you going to reach them?
- Are you blocked? - Is anything stopping you?
