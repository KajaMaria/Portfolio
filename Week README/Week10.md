## Code Quality - Solving user needs

- Dry
- SRP
- Readable & Maintainable
- Test coverage
- Dependency injection/ as a tool for decoupling

### We coding?
1. We write code to solve user needs
2. and for your team and yourself:
  This is where your code needs to be:
    - Readable:
        - descriptive:
          - variables - data it holds
        - Test is by ask someone else to read your code and see if they understand what it is doing.

    - Maintainable/ Easy to change 

Domain - subject of what we are trying to build

### When to use comments?
Good comments are usually are worth it when they explain why you have done things the way you did them -> example I am using error handler for this code because this API is flakey.
