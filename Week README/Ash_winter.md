# Testing

Ash Winter -> northern_tester
Leeds testing community

Issues within the community:

- Operation people / testers -> People see it as costs rather than value
- If you want to reduce resting it is a risk
- If i can't test completely but there will be bugs in it.
- Companies resisting test narrative

Test is dead - Google -> testing product at the end is not appropriate. Essentially testing idea is more important.

Why the resistance:
- Takes a while
- Great people at anything is a positive thing to happen

How to spot a great tester:
- What do you need by pen and why do you need that pen and what other testing have you done?

Types of testing you want to do:
- it is not a tester responsibility

- What is the team responsible for?

Def of Done for each of the users stories
- Acceptance test fo criteria
- demo
- performance test

Openness to pairing with testers
before building feature ask for opinion. How are you going to handle errors
Good tester would ask you how you would tested.
things that you might not have found
If developers want to show you something look at it
start early communication
Run your acceptance test locally?
