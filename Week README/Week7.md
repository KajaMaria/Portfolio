Preventing default behaviour - Have a look

This week we are doing further JavaScript! Single Page App:

- We have to write our own testing program for JS.

- Secondary goal to produce diagram. MVC kind of way.

- Have html

- In the challenge track it is a more like a weekly challenges in pairs. Project groups will have acceptance criteria.

1. Single Paige App

SPA - From the users perspective
Good user experience?
Models - in JS? some backend on Node and JS.

2. JS Modules

export vs import

Keyword - Export used in JS6

Why to use modules? If you define a function within another function you know that the content is secured. Similar to private functions.
You can use modules same as in Ruby - available to multiple functions.
Used to properly encapsulate a behaviour.

Good practice? - be consistent?
