# Team Projects!!

## Goals for the week
Ask yourself the same two questions:

Are you having fun?

Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?

Primary goal
By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

Can you use high-quality processes to build an extended project in a team?
Production code is generally built by a team of developers. It is important that you leave Makers with the skills needed to work in a team, and this is the primary reason that project weeks exist in the curriculum.

The final projects also provide a safe environment for you to be creative and enjoy exploring new directions with your code.



## Our Goals:
- Have fun
- Learn new tech, soft skills
- Teamwork
- Time frames
- Deliver a project
- Github - CV
